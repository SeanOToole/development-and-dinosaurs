                <p>
                    Like most website operators, Agile Katas collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Agile Katas's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Agile Katas's visitors use its website. From time to time, Agile Katas may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agile Katas also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Agile Katas only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
